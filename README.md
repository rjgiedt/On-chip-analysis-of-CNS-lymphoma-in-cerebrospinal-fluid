# On chip analysis of CNS lymphoma in cerebrospinal fluid

### Summary
Molecular profiling of central nervous system lymphomas in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples can be challenging due to the paucicellular and limited nature of the samples. Presented herein is a microfluidic platform for complete CSF lymphoid cell analysis, including single cell capture in sub-nanoliter traps, and molecular and chemotherapeutic response profiling via on-chip imaging, all in less than one hour. The system can detect scant lymphoma cells and quantitate their kappa/lambda immunoglobulin light chain restriction patterns. The approach can be further customized for measurement of additional biomarkers, such as those for differential diagnosis of lymphoma subtypes or for prognosis, as well as for imaging exposure to experimental drugs.

### Code
The code implemented here takes in avi formatted videos of images taken from the chip device described in the paper, segments cells captured by the chip, and analyzes their imaging/ fluorescent characteristics for diagnostic interpretation.
